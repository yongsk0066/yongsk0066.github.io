The immense gravity of Earth that must be overcome to reach the moon.\
Overcoming one's inherent nature is no simple feat.

'Truth' is sublime, 'falsehood' is practical.\
Between Earth and moon, one must conquer their respective gravities to traverse the space between.\
Between 'truth' and 'falsehood',

Someone's 'belief' is what enables them to overcome these gravitational pulls.

Unsurprisingly, this film too rests between 'fact' and 'fiction'.

In the Apollo 11 mission, there was neither a 'Cole Davis' nor a 'Kelly Jones'.


Reluctant to miss it, I watched the movie in the early hours of Sunday morning.\
Afterwards, I created a small animation.

The sun and Earth, the moon and Apollo 11 journeying between them.
